# Psychic-Game
Basic JavaScript Game for DU Coding Bootcamp

# Object
This game allows the user to try to guess a letter value that is stored by the "computer". This letter is randomly generated at the start of each round, and the users will have 15 changes to guess the correct letter.

If the user guesses the correct letter before the amount of guesses remaining reaches 0, then they will win the round, if they fail to do this then they will lose the round. Wins and losses are stored as long as the page is not refreshed, and upon winning or losing the round a new one will begin. 

In addition to wins and losses being recorded, the page will show the user's last guess and previous guesses within that particular round, these will be reset once the round is won or lost.
